# Exercise 1 The planets
# 1. Create a list of the planets in our solar system 
#    (in order from closest to the sun to farthest from the sun)
# 2. Use a for loop to print the planets
# 3. Count the number of planets and print it
#    concatenated with "There are _____ planets in our solar system"

   

#Exercise 2
# Use the index to print the following sentences:
# 1.   I live on _____.
# 2.   The closest planet to the sun is _____.

# 1. Print Is Pluto a planet? 
# 2. Pretend you're a group of arguing scientists. 
#    Write an illogical if statement to check if Pluto is in the planets list
#    If true, remove Pluto from the planet list
#    If not, append Pluto to the list
# 3. Use a for loop to print the updated planet list
# 4. Consult with scientists (Internet search).
#    Print the list of planets using a for loop. If the iteration variable is Pluto,
#    break the loop and print "Pluto is not a planet!".



# Exercise 4
# 1. Create a new list of non-planet bodies in the solar system, including Pluto
# 2. Combine it with the planets
# 3. Use a for loop to print out all the bodies in the solar system.
# 4. When the iteration variable is equal to Sun, 
#    print a sun fact and continue the loop



#Advanced students

# 2. Combine the alien list with the solar system list
# 3. Print a random item from the aliens list
# 4. Pop a random item from the aliens list 
# 5. Sort the aliens list
# 6. Loop through the combined lists. Inside the loop, check the value
# of the iteration variable, if it equals a certain alien, print
# "_____ has visited earth!" then continue
