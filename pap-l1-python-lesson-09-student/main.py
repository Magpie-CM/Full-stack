# Lesson 09: Lists
# Party Planning
# Exercise 1: List syntax
# 1. Create a list of snacks to serve at the party
# Include at least 5 items
# 2. Print the list



# Exercise 2
# 1. Improve the print output formating by iterating through the list with a for loop


# Exercise 3: Using the list index
# 1. Use the index to print the first snack
# 2. Use the index to print the third snack
#    Concatenate the values with a string such as: 
#    "The first snack on the list is"
# 3. Replace the third snack with a new snack
# 4. Use a for loop to print the updated snack list



# Exercise 4: Counting list items
# 1. Make Python count all the items in your snack list
# 2. Print the output concatenated with a string such as:
# "You have _____ items on your party snack list"


# Exercise 5: Combining lists
# 1. Create another list of party items you'll need such as plates, cups, napkins, etc.
# 2. Add it to the snacks list to create a master shopping list
# 3. Make Python count the items in your shopping list and print the total
# 4. Use an if statement to check if an item is in the shopping list
#    If true, print confirmation such as: "Yes, _____ is on the list."
#    If not, print something like "You forgot the the _____!"
# 5. Print the shopping list using a for loop


# Exercise 6: We forgot something! 
# Intro to objects and methods. Methods to add to and remove from lists
# 1. Append a forgotten item to the shopping list
# 2. Remove an unneeded item from the shopping list
# 3. Loop through and print each item in the updated shopping list 



#Bonus 2 
# If you want to print out the index numbers next to the list items,
# use the enumerate function in the for loop, like this:
# for index,item in enumerate(shopping_list):
#    print(f'{index}. {item}')
