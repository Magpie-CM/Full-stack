# Exercise 1: Make a new comment
#hi


# Exercise 2: Create 5 variables
# Hint: you can try values that are just numbers too, 
# but you don't need to put quotes around them, for example: var = 10
var1=1
var2=2
var3=3
var4=4
var5=5
# Exercise 3: print all 5 variables
print(var1)
print(var2)
print(var3)
print(var4)
print(var5)

# Exercise 4: Try commenting out some of your code, what happens?
#this function lists varible values and then prints them
# Exercise 5: Make sure all of your code works, revert changes if necessary.
