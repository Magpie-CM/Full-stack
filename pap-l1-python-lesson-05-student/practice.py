# Exercise 1
# 1. Create a function called about_you with 2 parameters, name, age
# Inside the function 
#  2. Print "Your name is " and concatenate the name
#  3. Print "You are" concatenate age "years old."
#  4. Call the function and send it a string argument for name, 
#  and an integer argument for age.



# Exercise 2
# 1. Create a function called table with 1 parameter: num
# Inside the function
#  2. Create a variable called results
#  3. Set its value to a multiline F string. Create a multiplication table, 
#  4. multiply num times the numbers 1-10, showing each calculation on a new line
#  5. for example: {num} x 1 = num*1
#  6. Print results
#  7. Call the function and send it an integer argument.
#  8. Get a number from the user, and convert it to an int. Call the function using the user's number

  

# Exercise 3
# 1. Get 3 responses from the user:
# What was the last thing you ate?
# What is the color of your pants?
# What was the last thing you bought?
# 2. Create a function called band_name with 3 parameters.
# Inside the function:
# 3. Print "Your bandname is..." using all 3 parameters
# 3. Call the function and send it the variables containing the user's 3 responses.




# Advanced students 
# Exercise 1 Use a keyword argument for age, call the function without a value for age.
# Exercise 2 Use a loop with one of line code inside it to produce the multiplication table.
# Exercise 3 Inside the function, use random to mix up the order of the parameters.
