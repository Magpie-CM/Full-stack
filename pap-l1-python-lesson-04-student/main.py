# Lesson 04 Defining Functions

# Exercise 1: Add a parameter to the greet function
# In main.py, define a function named greet with 1 parameter: name
# Inside the function, print "Hello", name
# Call the function and pass it a string argument: a person's name


# Exercise 2
# 1. Define another function called multiply
# Inside the function:
#   2. Get the first number from the user
#   3. Get a second number from the user
#   4. Multiply num1 and num2
#   5. Print the result of the multiplied numbers in this format: num1 x num2 = result
# 6. Unindent to call the function


# Exercise 3
# 1. Define a function called tip_calculator
# Inside the function:
#   2. Get the subtotal from the user and convert it to a float
#   3. Get the tip_percentage from the user and convert it to an int
#   4. Calculate the tip amount
#   5. Calculate the total
#   6. Print the subtotal, tip_percentage, tip, and total concatenated in an f string like:   Your subtotal is $
#       Tipping %
#       Your tip amount is $
#       Your total is $ 
#
# 7. Unindent to call the function


# Quick Test exercise
# Choose a variable from inside one of your functions.
# Outside of any function, print it.
# What happened?


# Exercise 4
# 1. Create a global variable called name
# 2. Set its value to get the user's name
# 3. Personalize the greet function to say hello to the user, 
# by replacing the word "world" with the name variable



# Exercise 5
# Refactor (reorganize) your code to place your global variable at the top, then function definitions, then function calls.



# Bonus: return statement
# Edit the code inside the multiply function
# 1. Instead of printing the f string, return it
# Edit the multiply function call
# 2. Assign a variable to the multiply function call
# 3. Print the variable
# 4. Test the program

# Practice Session
# Exercise 1
# Personalize the other 2 functions by adding the name variable into the print statements.
