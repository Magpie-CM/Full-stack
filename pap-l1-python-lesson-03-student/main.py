# Exercise 1: String practice + floats
# 1. Create a variable called banner and give it a string value
# 2. Print banner
# 3. Print a new line character
# 4. Create 3 variables: dinner1, dinner2, and drinks 
# Give each variable a float value


# Exercise 2: Arithmetic Operators
# 1. Create a variable called order_total, make its value the 
# sum of the variables in exercise 1
# 2. Print order_total, use a comma or an f string to 
# add it to a string like: "Your total is $"



# Exercise 3 Begin creating the Tip Calculator
# Getting user input
# 1. Create a variable user_total and make its value the result 
# of calling the input() function
# 2. Print user_total, use a comma or an f string to 
# add it to a string like: "You entered $"




# Exercise 4 Determining the type of data
# 1. Create a variable: user_total_type
# Assign it a value type()
# Pass type() the user_total variable
# Print user_total_type




# Exercise 5 Converting types
# 1. Convert user_total to a float
# 2. Print user_total, use a comma or f string to add it to a string like: "Your total is $"
# 3. Create a variable tip_percentage, get the value from the user 
# 4. Convert tip_percentage to an integer
# 5. Print tip_percentage, use an F string to insert it into text like: "Tipping: %"



# Exercise 6 Calculating the tip
# 1. Create a variable called tip, set its value to the math formula that will calculate the tip amount using tip_percentage and user_total
# 2. Print tip, use a comma or f string to add it to a string like: "Your tip amount is $"
# 3. Set a new value for order_total by adding the tip
# 4. Print order_total, add it to a string like: "Your new total is $"
