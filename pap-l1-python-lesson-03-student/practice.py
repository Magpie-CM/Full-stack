# Exercise 1: Go on a big shopping spree!
# Pretend you can buy anything you want no matter the cost. Buy at least 3 items. 
# 1. Create a variable for each item to store its price, and set its value to a float
# 2. Calculate the before tax subtotal and print it concatenated with a string: "Subtotal: "
# 3. Add a flat rate shipping charge ( a float) to the subtotal, and print the shipping rate concatenated with: "Shipping: "
# 4. Tax: calculate 10% of the subtotal, and print the tax amount concatenated with: "Tax: "
# 5. Calculate and print the final total amount concatenated with: "Total: "
# Hint: use a comma for concatenation



# Exercise 2: Calculate the perimeter and area of a circle
# 1. Create a valiable called pi and give it the float value of pi
# 2. Get the radius of the circle from the user, and convert it to a float
# 3. Using pi and radius, perform the calculation for finding the perimeter of a circle
# and print it, concatenate the output with a string like: "The perimeter of your circle is:"
# 4. Using pi and radius, perform the calculation for finding the area of a circle 
# and print it, concatenate the output with a string like: "The area of your circle is:"
