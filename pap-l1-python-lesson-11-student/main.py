# Create a game of rock, paper, scissors
# Use the code you already know, plus a few new concepts from the slides, to carry out the steps below.
# Game Outline
# 1. Announce the game and get the user's name
# 2. The user chooses from rock, paper, or scissors
# 3. Make sure the user's choice is valid
# 4. The computer makes a random choice
# 5. Python decides who won and prints the result
# 6. Refactoring

# Step 6: return statement
# 1. Create a function: play_rps_game()
# Cut/paste inside the function the code that gets and prints the player and computer choices, including the list valid_choices
# 2. Create a function:get_rps_game_results() with 2 parameters, player_choice, computer_choice
# Cut/paste all the code that decides who won inside the function
# Remove all 3 print statements, use return instead
# 3. Inside play_rps_game(), inside the else:
# Call get_rps_game_results() pass it player_choice, computer_choice
# Assign its output a variable: results
# Print results
# Outisde any function, call play_rps_game()
