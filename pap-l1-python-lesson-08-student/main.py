# Exercise 1 Count to 10 with a while loop
# 1. Create a variable counter and give it a value of 0
# 2. Create a while loop with condition counter less than or equal to 10
# 3. Inside the loop, print counter
# 4. Don't forget to increment counter!



# Exercise 2 Refactor the multiplication table code with a while loop
# 1. Create 2 variables, num and count
# 2. Create a while loop to repeat 10 times
# 3. Inside the loop print an f string showing 
#    the calculation of num times count and its result
# 4. Don't forget to increment count!  




# Exercise 3 Count to 10 with a for loop
# 1. Create a for loop with iteration variable c and range function for numbers 1 through 10
# 2. Inside the for loop print c. Did it count all the way to 10?
# 3. Create another for loop to count from 2 to 10 using even numbers
# 4. Inside the loop, print c




# Exercise 4 Break and continue
# 1. Create a for loop to repeat code 50 times
# 2. Inside the loop, print the iteration variable
# 3. If the value of the iteration variable is equal to 5, print "Hello!" and continue
# 4. If the value of the iteration variable is equal to 45, stop the loop

 


# Exercise 5 Making a tree!
# 1. The following code will print a tree shape.
# Uncomment it and test. Do you notice a pattern? 
''' print(F"""
{" " * 10}{"#" * 2}
{" " * 9}{"#" * 4}
{" " * 8}{"#" * 6}
{" " * 7}{"#" * 8}
{" " * 6}{"#" * 10}
{" " * 5}{"#" * 12}
{" " * 4}{"#" * 14}
{" " * 3}{"#" * 16}
{" " * 2}{"#" * 18}
{" " * 1}{"#" * 20}
{" " * 10}||
""") ''' 
# Create a variable counter with value 10
# Create a variable leaf with value 2
# Create a while loop to repeat code as long as the counter is greater than 0
# Inside the loop, print one line of the tree f string, replacing the numbers with the counter and leaf variables as necessary.
# Increment leaf by 2. 
# Decrement counter by 1
# Exit the loop and print the code for the trunk




   

# Bonus exercise
# 1. Import randint from random
# 2. Create a variable, set its value to a random number between 1 and 100
# 3. Create a for loop that repeats code 100 times
# 4. Inside the for loop, print the iteration variable
# 5. If the value of the iteration variable is equal to the random number, 
# print "Finished early!" and break the loop
