# from random import randint

# Exercise 1 Refactor the multiplication table code with a for loop
# 1. Create a variable: num , set its value to integer of your choice  
# 2. Create a for loop with iteration variable c and 
#    range function for numbers 1 through 10
# 3. Inside the for loop, print an f string showing 
#    the calculation of num times the iteration variable and its result
# 4. Give num a new value and test again


# Exercise 2 
# 1. Put the multiplication for loop you created in Exercise 1 inside a function with 1 parameter
# 2. Get a number to be multiplied from the user 
# 3. Call the function and pass it the user's number
    
     

# Exercise 3: Christmas tree lot  
# 1. Ask the user how tall they want their tree, convert it to an integer and save it in a variable.
# 2. Edit the tree code to make the tree as many lines tall as the customer ordered.
# 3. Don't forget to adjust the trunk. Hint: the value of the user's height ends at 0, so you must use leaf instead. 
# Remember to check for the data type of any calculation output, and use type conversion.



# Exercise 4: Make an upside down tree
# 1. Copy, paste, and edit the loop that makes the tree so it appears upside down.
# 2. Don't forget the trunk


# Advanced students, use a for loop to make your upside down tree

# Exercise: Create a slot machine game.
# Each player gets 5 rounds to get a jackpot
# 1. Create a variable for total rounds.
# 2. Create a variable to keep score
# 3. Create a variable for rounds played
# 3. Create a while loop that runs until the rounds are over
# 4. Inside the loop,
#   Ask the user if they wish to keep playing, if true: 
#   Generate 3 random numbers between 1 and 7
#   Create a conditional statement that checks for:
#    jackpot (all 3 match)
#    double ( 2 match)
#    loss (no matches)
#   Print the slots and result of each round
# 6. Outside the loop, print the results of all 5 rounds
