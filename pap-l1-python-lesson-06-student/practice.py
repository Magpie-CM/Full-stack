# Practice Session
# Exercise 1
# Plot twist! Your wealthy friend is going to pay half the total Broadway show bill!
# Copy the function you made in exercise 5 of the in-class practice. Edit it to
# print how much each of the rest of your friends will owe.
# Uh oh! You may need to copy some other code from that file as well.


# Exercise 2
# Make a function that keeps a single cumulative score for a pretend game
# 1. Create a global variable named score
# 2. Define a function called play with 1 parameter
# Inside the function,
# 3. Bring score into the function using the global keyword
# 4. Increase the amount of the score variable by the parameter
# 5. Print the current value of score at the end of a string like:
# "Your current score is:"
# 6. Call the function and pass it an integer.
# 7. Call the function at least 3 more times to test it.



# Advanced students
# Exercise 1 Re-write the play function so it updates the cumulative scores of at least 3 players
# Make sure each player can input their own name, and their latest score
# Print out each player's name with their cumulative score
# Exercise 2 Get a number from a user and convert it to an integer
# Use the modulo and an if/else block to determine whether the number is odd or even
# Print the result
