# Lesson 06 
# Exercise 1
# You and your friends are planning to go to a Broadway Revue! 
# A Revue is a kind of musical theater with lots of different performers and skits.
# Create 3 variables with these values:
# (Make up your own variable names and details)
# Name of the show
# Number of tickets 
# Ticket price




# Exercise 2: String concatenation, arithmetic operators
# Pretend you're sharing a message on social media about going to the show. 
# 1. Create a message variable with a string value. The string is your announcement about the event. Concatenate it with the name of the show.
# 2. Calculate the total cost for you and your friends to go. 
# Use number of tickets, ticket price, and 10% tax to calculate the order total
# You will need new variables for: 
# subtotal
# tax
# order total





# Exercise 3: Do stuff!
# 1. Print the variable you made that stores your social media announcement
# 2. Print your ticket receipt, concatenated with a string like,
# "It will cost $"
# 3. Print a review of the show, (look up any review online)
# Pass the function a multiline f string, 
# concatenate your variables for: 
# show name 
# ticket price



# Exercise 4 User input, type conversion
# Now that you've shared your news about the show, you have more friends who want to go!
# 1. Ask them how many tickets they want and save their answer in a variable
# 2. Convert their answer into an integer



# Exercise 5 Defining functions, scope, parameters and arguments
# You have friend who need tickets. Make a function to calculate the new total cost.
# 1. Define a function with 1 parameter
# 2. Inside the function:
# Use the global keyword to bring your variable for the number of tickets inside the function. 
# 3. To calculate the new total number of tickets, change its value to itself plus the parameter for example: 
# num_tickets = num_tickets + param
# 4. Copy the code you made earlier that calculates the order total, with tax, etc.
# and paste it, make any necessary adjustments
# 5. Print the total amount due
# 6. Call the function passing it the number of tickets your friends said they wanted
